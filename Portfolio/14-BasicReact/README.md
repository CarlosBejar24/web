# Basic React

- Using the _data.js_ file provided in public, create an interface that displays a card-like array of the 6 movies listed in there. Use the poster of every entry for the card and put the name of the movie and the year in the description of the card.
- Let the card have a link or button that says "More...", when clicked, you must display below the cards a section containing the image, name and bio of the most prominent character of the movie as stated in the _data.js_ file.
- When hovering over the card of the movie, the image should change to display the logo of the affiliation of the main character as per its data. When it is a good affiliation, the color should be blue and when it is an evil one it should be red.
- The card should also have a like and dislike button that should keep track of the overall appreciation of the movie by the users.
- When the subsection of the detail of the movie is shown, the users should see a form that grants them the possibility of adding a comment to that section. These comments should be kept for the duration of the session, in other words, this should not be saved between sessions. Every entry should have name and comment.
