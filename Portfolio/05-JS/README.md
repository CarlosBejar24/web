# Simple JS Exercises

These exercises will just show multiple ways in which JS can interact with our web page. The implementation of the following exercises are just simple ways to display them. Some of these codes are implemented in old JS versions, but are provided as such for the understanding of the student.

**You must complete at least 8 points for full credit**

---

## Clock - 2 pts

Complete the clock exercise by completing the tasks requested in the code by the _TODO_ labels.

---

## Fibonacci - 1 pt

Solve for the requested fibonacci number.

---

## Images - 1 pt

Move the image around the screen using the controls. Make sure that it always stay inside the viewport

---

## Primes - 2 pts

Extract the prime factors of the number given and show them in the "pf" span.

### To get the factors of a number

Following are the steps to find all prime factors.

1. While n is divisible by 2, print 2 and divide n by 2.
2. After step 1, n must be odd. Now start a loop from i = 3 to the square root of n. While i divides n, print i, and divide n by i. After i fails to divide n, increment i by 2 and continue.
3. If n is a prime number and is greater than 2, then n will not become 1 by the above two steps. So print n if it is greater than 2.

## Next primes - 1 pt.

Get the next prime value after the number provided.

---

## Pig Latin - 2 pts

Pig Latin is a language game or argot in which words in English are altered, usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable to create such a suffix.

Transform the input received into its pig latin version. Fix or complete the code provided to make it work.

## Sieve of Eratosthenes - 3 pts

Get the value provided and then get all the prime numbers below that one.

Look for the algorithm and implement it.

---

## Society parody - 3 pts

This is a game that will show you how happiness/sadness affects the surronding people. In this game you start with a society with initial happy/sad parameters given by the individuals that are there. They will interact with each other and their happy factors will change, depending on which character contacts who. When the happyness values go below 0, then the subject will turn sad, but if the happyness values goes above 1, they will become happy people.

Implement the missing methods as required in the TODO messages in the code.
