# React Authentication

---

- Once again, re-use the exercise on our previous entry in our portfolio and add to it a login/signup form that will allow the user to be registered.
- If the user has not been authenticated, he will only be able to see the data, but not modify it; this is, they will not be able to do like/dislike or add new comments. On the contrary, once authenticated, the user will be able to add/edit data and this should be saved in the backend.
- Implement the state management using Redux & Thunk
