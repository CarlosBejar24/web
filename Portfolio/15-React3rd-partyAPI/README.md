# React with API (local & 3rd party)

---

- Recreate the exercise we did in the previous entry of the portfolio, but now provide the information from a backend server.
- Use React-bootstrap elements to do a reactive design
- Now, on every card, instead of displaying the detail of the movie below the cards, redirect it to a new component that should be only displayed via react-router
- Make sure that the like/dislike functionality is still working.
- Also make sure that the user can still save the comments through different sessions; that is, make sure you save the entries in a Mongo instance.
