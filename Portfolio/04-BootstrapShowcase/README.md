# Bootstrap Exercises

Bootstrap is a very dynamic and responsive library.

As explained in class this library allows for quick design and implementation given a big list of examples and clear explanation on how to customize them.
In this exercise you need to implement at least one of each of these components

- Navbar and/or tabs <!--Listo-->
- Accordion <!--Listo-->
- Buttons <!--Listo-->
- Button groups <!--Listo-->
- Card <!--Listo-->
- Modal <!--Listo-->
- Pop over<!--Listo-->
- Progress <!--Listo-->
- Spinner <!--Listo-->
- Tooltips <!--Listo-->
- Iconic link <!--Listo-->
- Floating labels <!--Listo-->
- Borders & background <!--Listo-->

The result of this exercise must behave in a responsive way, that means that it should look good in a screen or in a phone or tablet, so make sure that you use the proper elements to allow this to happen. These elements can be unrelated to each other and just in the same page in the vaccum; but I would suggest that you try to include these elements in your Personal Website project to improve its quality. Be aware that in the final version of the Personal Website your site will have to be responsive and look amazing!

Select 5 elements from the following list and make a small demo of how would you implement it in a project.
